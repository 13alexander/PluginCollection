### Pull Requests
Pull requests should have the following things:

1. The commits should have a descriptive message and which is not in the past tense.

  For example:  
  `Describe the XYZ plugin with more detail.` or `Add config for XYZ.` is good, but: `Added XYZ.` isn't.

2. Content should be grammatically correct and the spelling should be US English, e.g. Color not Colour.
