## Minehut.com Player-Server Plugin Repository
Public plugin repo used in the /minehut plugin menu. 

## How to Contribute
To get a plugin added to the menu, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Minehut/PluginCollection/issues) with a link to the page where the plugin can be downloaded and a short description/rationale for adding it to the menu. 

If you want to get a plugin made by you added, upload the source code where we can view it (such as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)), and we will compile it ourselves for security purposes.

Before submitting a plugin request, be aware that the plugin should be...
* **...publicly available**, and in the case of a private plugin made by you, the source code viewable.
* **...available for free from the original author**. This repository is publicly viewable and all files on it can be downloaded, so "premium" or non-free plugins are not allowed without explicit consent from the author(s).
* **...updated** for the version of Minecraft which Minehut is currently running on.
* **...free of any known bugs.** The plugin should have been tested for any bugs that break its intended function(s).
